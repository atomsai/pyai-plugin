# Voice Agents

Use the connected PyAI tool schemas as the source of truth; clients may prefix tool IDs with the server name. If PyAI is disconnected, direct the user to the host's browser sign-in. Keep credentials out of chat. Respect the selected project and the user's authorized task.

Tools: `whoami`, `list_voices`, `list_agents`, `create_agent`, `get_agent`, `update_agent`, `set_agent_tools`, `set_agent_knowledge`

Establish the task, greeting, persona, language and voice. Resolve a voice from `list_voices`; inspect an existing agent before updating it. Use the schema's `body` object for profile fields. Creating a profile is a persistent change, so do it when the user requests creation, not merely to provide a code example.

Attach only the requested tools and knowledge to the selected agent. Return its actual ID and explain the next integration step.

MCP manages profiles; it does not itself start a microphone session or place a phone call. For a live conversation, use the Omni SDK or WebSocket integration with the saved agent ID as `session_label`. Fetch the current realtime guide at https://docs.pyai.com/guides/omni-overview. Do not invent WebSocket events, supported languages or telephony actions.
